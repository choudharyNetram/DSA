// tip:- many question is solvable with the help of map but interviewer many times ask about a different aproach to solve 
// so solve question with more than one approach 



// check is List is palindrome or not in O(n) time complexity and O(1)space complexity 

// if (reverse list == List)  than return true :- we also can't make new List so what to do??

// find middle, and then reverse the list after middle, and then start one pointer from head and one from after one node of middle 
// if both value at each time is same than List is palindrome
